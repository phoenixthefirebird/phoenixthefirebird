⚡ Fun fact:
- I started going to the gym three years ago and have been going consistently ever since, never regret stopping running for the gains :woman-lifting-weights:
- I am obsessed with birds, by that I mean OBSSESSED. Seeing cute bird (or pictures of them) is probably the only thing that can cheer me up in the case of a failed exam (not that I had one yet) :dove_of_peace::bird:
- I have a hummingbird feeder and enjoy looking at those nimble little buggers
- I subscribe to technology breakthrough newsletters and so far they have inspired potential research topics :nerd_face:
- I make sure to get at least 8 hours of sleep everyday and never pull all nighters :sleeping:(efficiency intensifies)
- I enjoy a good sci-fi novel and would sometimes read for hours at a time :books:(homework screaming in the background)
- I'm a skincare junkie, I have research about skincare ingredients and now maintains a low budget but highly effective routine that leaves me with glowing skin (not an advertisement I'm happy to share my knowledge:stuck_out_tongue:)
- I love being financially savvy and will read up about investment strategies and go to relevant workshops (there is one coming up hosted by UBC)
